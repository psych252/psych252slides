What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
"Tobi, you explain so well!! Thank you so much :)"
Would be helpful to go backwards on each term. For example if you explain the use of a standard deviation also explain what would happen if you removed that or if you set it to a larger or smaller value
Might just be me but I have trouble seeing the red laser pointer on the screen. Could you try using your mouse or even your hand as well? Thanks!
I think we need more worked examples

I loved today
