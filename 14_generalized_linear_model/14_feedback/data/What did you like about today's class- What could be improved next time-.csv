What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
thanks for responding questions so clearly :)
"It would be great if at the end of each statistical test, or at least some, you could interpret as you would when writing it for a publication."
Today was the first day I felt lost in the details and wasn't sure what exactly to take away from the lecture.
"I was a little distracted by how long the question and answers were, but understand thats a difficult balance to strike."
Is there any way we could also put maths equations in just to explain some of the things we are going through in class? Sometimes I get what it means theoretically but still wanna get a glimpse of how it really works underneath the code.
