What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
"This was a very encouraging introduction to the class. I really appreciated the breakdown of teaching goals, tools to be used, and course expectations (time commitment, etc.)."
I wouldn't change anything
I liked how you clearly stated the reasons for why R is still relevant as opposed to switching everything to python
IT'S AMAZING
I liked how we received a comprehensive overview of what we will learn in this class. I don't have any suggestions for improvement right now!
I liked that expectations and course assignments were clearly stated. Can't think of anything that can be improved.
"First half with Nilam was slower, and second half with Tobi went a little too quickly (had to pull up the slides and backread to understand course logistics)"
Thank you for your positive attitude :) was having a bad day but this class really brighten my mood
"I think today's class provided us with a great overview with what to expect in this class, what is expected of us, and what we are going to learn. It got me very excited for this class!"
I liked that we had a glimpse about the whole course. I'd like to perhaps add a bit of content to the first class so people understand better what the class look like.
I loved the teaching style
I'm excited about learning R - I think this pace was great for an introduction and overview but would be too fast for R and statistical concepts.

"I appreciated the humor, and the deep overview of class expectations. I would like for next class to mention the possible topics of data & projects we'll be working on. For ex: I'm a qualitative researcher, and don't even know yet how to formulate a research question with quantitative data in mind. Thinking about the final project is daunting since I don't even know what topics I could use for that project. Briefly discussing strategies to deal with this would be super helpful!"
"None, good start to the course"
I really liked the analogies used to clarify/explain topics.
I liked the jokes and the stretching break. Thank you!
I'm happy with the pacing and the detail of the course plan!
it was a little fast and the qr codes were sometimes too small to scan!! but overall so excited and i really appreciated your holistic background and intentionality in the course! thanks for sharing about the problematic history of stats too
"Clarified the course content, learning goals, how to get help/resources. Professors were enthusiastic and brought a positive energy to a course that can be intimidating for some!"
Instructors were both engaging and very organized. I had some trouble accessing the pollev site due to wifi issues.
The pace was right and I liked the mix of humor and good music!
The music ;)
