What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
I still think the pace was a little too fast for seeing the solutions after we stepped through them. What I did appreciate is the stepping through the solution out loud.
I think the excercises are really helpful and its very helpful to then go through the correct solution together!
I liked going through the code and exercises together
"Excellent, learned a lot, thank you!"
I appreciated the detailed explanations of each line of code!
Music to my ears when Prof. Tobi said he would the solutions from the practice problems to canvas. That will be helpful for stepping through on my own time.
