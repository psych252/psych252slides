What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
everything was explained clearly
"I really appreciated the tutorial-style introduction to R -- in the past, I've had to figure out much of these syntax things in a new language by a combination of Googling and trial-and-error. I did have difficulty making my RStudio setup mirror what the instructor showed-- a slower introduction to the different panels in RStudio and how they can be arranged would have helped!"
felt pretty slow for folks already familiar with R but probably quite important for the class as a whole so no complaints!!! getting on the same page re: coding style was helpful.
"Great class, thank you!"
i liked the interactive aspects of lecture. i wish there wre mroe frequent check ins with the audience about questions.
I loved the follow-along. Would love to see the answer code snippet for the practice questions.
I appreciated having the advanced exercises.
loved it!
I thought there was a great balance of instruction and hands-on learning.
I love have a working document with exercises - it's so interactive.
Very clear!
everything was excellent :)
I love the music - thank you :')
I wished we were able to go over the advanced answers as well!
"For coding-heavy classes, it may benefit from having a different classroom if possible? Less lecture-ish and more workshop/CS classroom? Maybe somewhere will be available once the data sci building opens :)"
It's really fun!
The pace was good.

The pace was perfect and I feel like I learned a lot by following along and typing things out myself!
I liked the demonstration and tips provided throughout the session.
"I liked simple tutorials and time to work on our own, particularly jumping ahead to more advanced plots. I'd like more opportunities to work on more advanced stuff in the future, but I'm sure the class will ramp up!"
It was helpful to walk through the coding examples step-by-step.
Good intro into plotting!
"I really liked going through everything together, with images below. I think if I hadn't gone to the Tuesday session and saw the material in advance I would have felt a little left behind by the pace of the class, but I really enjoyed it!"
