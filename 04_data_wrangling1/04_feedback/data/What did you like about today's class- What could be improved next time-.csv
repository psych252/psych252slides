What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
This pace was slightly faster/skipped around more than last week but I understand that we have limited class time.
Your demeanor and the vibes of the class could not be better! I really enjoy coming to this class.
A few more exercises during the class.
I really enjoyed being able to use the knowledge I just learned on the practice chunk.
"The practical exercises are fun, useful and appropriate for the amount of time given. The background music while solving the exercises is also very fun, please keep it."
maybe spend more time on the practice problem when reviewing it!
I like the pace. There might be some advanced R students in this class but I appreciate how the instructor accommodated students like me who are R beginners. I would appreciate if the instructor not speed up so students like me can catch up and learn. Thank you!
i enjoy working through examples and getting guidance on best practices
I know its hard to do this in the first couple of sessions where you're just teaching syntax and how to use r but would love more participation opportunities!
Honestly no feedback this was perfect for me. This is my first serious statistics class and it has felt very manageable so far!
"I'm very satisfied, especially with today's class. I'd prefer fewer group activities in future sessions."
"I went through the lecture before hand so I didn't think the pace was truly too fast, but if it was the first time with the content it may have been too quick to remember. In the future, one way to remedy that (in my opinion) would be to have a bit more practice! Then you can test yourself to see if you remember what you learned!"
I liked the visual examples and following through the code together
I liked the examples. I found it hard to continue paying attention. Maybe more practice examples would help
Thank you! Could you please remind us of the shortcuts again and again? Great class.
"The practical tips about shortcuts and other ways of using R and dplyr are super helpful! It would be nice to work with some dataframes that aren't already nicely formatted though, like one from Qualtrics, because that's what I struggle with"
"I liked the live coding! I would appreciate if you were able to explain to us how we should go about thinking through coding. For example, ""I want to filter so my first logical step is to do this..."""
Working through .rmd together was great!
I like how we go over the examples together
I really liked that we could follow along in R. I appreciate when you continue to remind us what the shortcuts are. I think I am getting the hang of it!
Live coding in class was very helpful! I was a bit confused with the order for pipe but seeing Prof. Gerstenberg explain it as he was doing it helped!
"Learned a few neat tricks (F2 instead of View, ~ for an anonymous function)"
"we went through the practice way too fast. My typing slowed down not because I was finish, but because I was still thinking by looking through the examples and figuring out what I did wrong.  What would be helpful is after we go through the solution for the practice, leaving it up for a while to compare where I went wrong. For example, in practice 2, I didn't put a space in between the names, height. I looked back at my syntax and realized I need that space. So, just slowing down to see the solution."
Really helpful! Could you please remind us what the shortcuts are as you use them? I'm grateful to learn them but need reminders.
"I appreciate having the instructors code the examples and giving us space to try things on our own. I think group coding might also be helpful for examples that are a little more complicated. I am roughly familiar with R, but I think if I had less familiarity the groundwork information would have felt very fast because with my base it felt a little fast"
