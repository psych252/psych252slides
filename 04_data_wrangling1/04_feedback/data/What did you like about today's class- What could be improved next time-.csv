What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
Pace was great
Thank you so much!! Best class this term
If the TAs can reposition themselves around the room so they can better see us holding blue notes up for help that would be great. Thank you!
I liked that all the code was explained to make sense of it
I liked that there were more instructions before the practice
:)
Great overview of the essentials!
