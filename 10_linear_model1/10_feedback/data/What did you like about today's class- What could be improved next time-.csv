What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
"The explanations of concepts and examples are very clear and widely accessible to students with varying stats and programming background. I appreciate the focus on developing  both intuition and practical skills, in contrast to many other stats class that seem to prioritize one or the other."
The phase was a tad too fast. Also I really really appreciate the jokes and analogies! (I really hope they continue) That's the only way I can get through all these STATS :(
Please standardize grading among TAs. maybe TAs can proactively walk around during section and offer help. Please write in plain speak what the equations are - helpful to have them in English
