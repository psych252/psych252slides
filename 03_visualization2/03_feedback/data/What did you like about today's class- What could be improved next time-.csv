What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
"I appreciate how the instruction is tailored to the skill and experience level of the class, and I think Tobi does a nice job of transitioning from more advanced to more basic topics as needed. It would be helpful to have perhaps an extra minute to work on the practice plots during class."
Sometimes you finish giving the answer for an activity but does not allow for time so we can fix our own. Would be helpful to just have a few seconds before we move on. Thanks :)
