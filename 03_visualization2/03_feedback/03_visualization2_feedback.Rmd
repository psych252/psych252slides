# What did you like? What can be improved? 

> liked that we dived into actual material, thought it was well-paced. if you could post the rmds with solutions after class (which I think you said you would) that would be super helpful to go back to when we forget something

> "Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do." — Donald Knuth

> Really like the breakout discussion & practice. Learned good stuffs.

> I liked everything. Would be great to have a cheatsheet that we can reference for some common graph types.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
read_csv("data/What did you like about today's class- What could be improved next time-.csv",
         skip = 1,
         show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  datatable()
```

# What to do next time

- have a cheatsheet with common graph types
