This repository contains the slides and RMarkdown notes for the course ["Psych 252: Statistical methods for the behavioral and social sciences"](https://psych252.github.io/) taught by Tobias Gerstenberg at Stanford University. 

## Course description

This course offers an introduction to advanced topics in statistics with the focus of understanding data in the behavioral and social sciences. It is a practical course in which learning statistical concepts and building models in R go hand in hand. The course is organized into three parts: In the first part (classes 1-8), we will learn how to visualize, wrangle, and simulate data in R. In the second part, we will cover topics in frequentist statistics (such as multiple regression, logistic regression, and mixed effects models) using the general linear model as an organizing framework. We will learn how to compare models using simulation methods such as bootstrapping and cross-validation (classes 9-21). In the third part, we will focus on Bayesian data analysis as an alternative framework for answering statistical questions (classes 22-25).

## Folders

Each folder contains the materials for one 90 min class session. This includes the keynote slides (.key), a pdf of the slides, an RMarkdown script that implements all the technical materials discussed in that class, as well as student feedback on that class. 

You can find all of the notes compiled into a single book [here](https://psych252.github.io/psych252book/).

Please don't hesitate to reach out or post an issue if you have questions about the materials. Thanks!
