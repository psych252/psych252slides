What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
"I think it would have been interesting to hear some more details about the different cross-validation methods! Like one of the students asked, what things you might want to consider in practical contexts in terms of reporting + tradeoffs between different methods."
"First part felt too fast, rest of the class felt good!"
It was good speed! I really need to be super engaged in class to keep up but I suppose that's probably good practice
Slowing down and explaining concepts using analogies and connections to research questions
"i actually really liked the part on cross-validation, felt like i learned a lot"
I liked seeing the demo and plan to work through it on my own. Personally I prefer to go deeper into the stats theory in class and then pursue the more wrangling/R-specific features on my own. But all helpful!
